            <p>Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS (born 8 June 1955) is the inventor of the World Wide Web and he created a new computer language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which most web pages are written in. The first web page was available on 6 August 1991.

                Berners-Lee now leads the World Wide Web Consortium. That is an organization that looks after the World Wide Web. He is the author of the book Weaving the Web. He is a director of The Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the
                 MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In April 2009, he was elected as a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, based in Washington, D.C. In 1999, Time Magazine named Berners-Lee one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. In March
                  2000 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.In 1989, while working at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a global hypertext project, to be known as the World
                   Wide Web. Based on the earlier "Enquire" work, it was designed to allow people to work together by combining their knowledge in a web of hypertext documents. He wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd", and the first client, "WorldWideWeb" a what-you-see-is-what-you-get 
                   hypertext browser/editor which ran in the NeXTStep environment. This work was started in October 1990, and the program "WorldWideWeb" first made available within CERN in December, and on the Internet at large in the summer of 1991.</p>
